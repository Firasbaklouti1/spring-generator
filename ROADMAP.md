🚀 Firas Spring Generator — Ultimate Roadmap
🎯 Vision

Become the #1 open-source, AI-assisted, extensible Spring Boot generator with:

Clean architecture support

Full SQL → CRUD → REST → services

Plugin/module ecosystem

IDE integration via MCP / CLI / API

Optional frontend + DevOps scaffolding

AI-assisted business logic generation

🗺️ Phase 1 — Core MVP (Foundation) ✅

Goal: Clone Start.Spring.io + your custom SQL → CRUD features.

Features to Implement:

Web UI for project config (dependencies, Java version, architecture)

Backend to build Spring Boot projects and export ZIP

SQL → Entity generation with JPA relationships

CRUD service + repository + controller templates

Presets: Web API, Full CRUD, Security Basic, MySQL Starter

Maven / Gradle support

Strengths borrowed:

Start.Spring.io simplicity

Bootify clean, minimal project output

🧩 Phase 2 — Advanced Code Generation & Architecture

Goal: Beyond standard scaffolding — configurable architecture & advanced code.

Features to Implement:

Multiple architecture styles: Layered / Clean / Hexagonal / Microservices

DTOs, Mapper classes, validation

Option to generate tests + exception handling + audit columns

Custom template engine (Freemarker / Mustache)

Connect directly to live DB → introspect tables → generate full backend

Auto-generate Postman collections and sample requests

Strengths borrowed:

JHipster’s architecture templates

Workik/Wizzdi SQL → Entity + API mapping

XBoot DSL/structure awareness

⚡ Phase 3 — Developer Experience & Automation

Goal: Make it super developer-friendly.

Features to Implement:

Live code preview / IDE-like experience

SQL schema error checking + validation

Project presets (microservice, monolith, API-only, full-stack)

CLI tool: springforge init <preset>

Auto-generate Docker + docker-compose files

Optional frontend scaffolding (Angular/React)

Generate CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)

Strengths borrowed:

Bootify lightweight UI + developer-first

JHipster DevOps integration

🧠 Phase 4 — AI Integration & MCP

Goal: Make it AI-assisted and IDE-integrated.

Features to Implement:

MCP server → IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ) for 1-click project creation

AI-assisted code generation:

CRUD + Services + Controllers

Generate business logic from SQL + descriptions

Auto-generate DTOs, tests, validations, relationships

ERD → full module generation

Auto-optimize generated code for readability + clean architecture

AI suggestions for project refactoring

Strengths borrowed:

Workik AI-assisted logic

Wizzdi ERD → module generation

🌐 Phase 5 — SaaS + Cloud / Monetization

Goal: Offer cloud + subscription options.

Features to Implement:

User accounts + cloud storage for templates / generated projects

API key system for automated project generation

Paid tiers:

Starter: Basic generator

Pro: AI + advanced codegen + presets

Team: Shared templates, private generators

Optional cloud-based project history / backup

Strengths borrowed:

Workik + Wizzdi cloud offering

🏗️ Phase 6 — Plugin & Template Ecosystem

Goal: Build a community-driven generator ecosystem.

Features to Implement:

Plugin / module marketplace

Community templates for different architectures, libraries, modules

Extensible code generators for new frameworks / microservices / frontend

Strengths borrowed:

Wizzdi / Bootify ecosystem concept (extendable templates)

🏁 Phase 7 — Full-stack / Advanced Features

Goal: Make the generator the “full project solution” for devs.

Features to Implement:

Full-stack scaffolding (Angular / React frontend + Spring Boot backend)

Monorepo + microservice orchestration (gateway, discovery, config)

Automated test scaffolding (unit + integration)

DevOps generator: Docker, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipelines

Custom reporting modules for monitoring + logging

Strengths borrowed:

JHipster microservices orchestration

Workik / Wizzdi multi-module approach

📌 Phase 8 — Open-Source & Community Growth

Goal: Become the de facto open-source alternative.

High-quality docs & tutorials

GitHub + Discord community for templates & plugins

Encourage contributions for modules, architecture patterns, AI models

Public API → developers can integrate with IDE / CI/CD pipelines

Strengths borrowed:

Open-source engagement (JHipster, Bootify)

🧭 Long-term Vision

Developer-first, open, AI-powered, modular Spring Boot generator

Clean architecture out-of-the-box

AI-assisted business logic generation

Full microservice / full-stack scaffolding

Marketplace & ecosystem for templates, plugins, modules

IDE integration + MCP server + CLI tool

Outcome: If you complete this roadmap, your generator would surpass Wizzdi, Bootify, and most others in developer-friendliness, flexibility, AI capabilities, and open-source community adoption.
